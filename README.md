# XSLT Conversion script for standalone printing

The setup of the directory structure should make the script available to the
(lpb-print)[https://github.com/lombardpress/lbp-print] script that makes the
processing of XML files easier. I have not really tested how it works with the
script yet though, so good luck!

This script should be used for creating standalone print editions.
